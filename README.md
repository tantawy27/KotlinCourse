# Kotlin Learning Journey
This repository contains my personal progress and projects as I learn Kotlin, a statically-typed programming language that is fully interoperable with Java. Through various exercises and projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of Kotlin's core concepts, such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, null safety, coroutines, and more. This repository will be regularly updated as I continue to explore new topics and improve my skills in Kotlin development.
